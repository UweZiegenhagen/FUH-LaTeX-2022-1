  abstract      = {In recent work, Hess and Shipley defined a theory of topological coHochschild homology (coTHH) for coalgebras. In this paper we develop computational tools to study this new theory. In particular, we prove a Hochschild-Kostant-Rosenberg type theorem in the cofree case for differential graded coalgebras. We also develop a coB\"okstedt spectral sequence to compute the homology of coTHH for coalgebra spectra. We use a coalgebra structure on this spectral sequence to produce several computations.},
